          <p>
            This agreement and any sales thereunder shall be deemed to have been made in the province of Alberta and shall
            be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the province of Alberta and the applicable laws of
            Canada. The parties hereby agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the province of Alberta.s

          <h2 className="text-2xl">3. Payment Terms; Orders; Quotes; Interest</h2>
          <p>
            Terms of payment are within CSC’s sole discretion, and unless otherwise agreed to by CSC, payment must be
            received by CSC prior to CSC’s acceptance of an order. Payment for the products and services may be made by
            credit card, or some other prearranged payment method unless credit terms have been agreed to by CSC. If
            credit terms have been agreed to by CSC, invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days after the date
            of the invoice. CSC may invoice parts of an order separately. Orders are not binding upon CSC until accepted
            by CSC. Any quotations given by CSC will be valid for the period stated on the quotation. Customer agrees to
            pay interest on all amounts past due at a rate of two percent (2.0%) per month.

          <p>
            Separate charges for shipping and handling will be shown on the invoice(s). Unless Customer provides CSC with
            a valid and correct tax exemption certificate applicable to the product ship-to location prior to CSC’s
            acceptance of the order, the Customer is responsible for goods and services tax, sales and all other taxes
            associated with the order, however designated, except taxes on CSC’s net income. If applicable, a separate
            charge for taxes will be shown on the invoice.

            Title to products passes from CSC to Customer on shipment from CSC’s facility. Loss or damage that occurs
            during shipping is Customer’s responsibility. CSC is not liable for delays in shipment or failure to ship by
            the estimated ship date. Where customer has ACCEPTED to insure their shipment (at time of order) then CSC will
            assist customer with, but is not liable for, their insurance claim against the shipping company for loss or
            damage. Where customer has DECLINED to insure their shipment (at time of order) then CSC is not liable for or
            in any way responsible for any loss or damage however caused

          <p>
            The limited warranties applicable to products sold by CSC are the sole responsibility of the product
            manufacturer offering such warranties. CSC disclaims all warranties and conditions, express or implied,
            including without limitation implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
            purpose. CSC’s sole responsibility for warranty claims is limited to assisting the customer to contact the
            manufacturer. Some provinces do not permit the exclusion of certain implied warranties or conditions or
            limitations on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts in consumer transactions. Therefore, the
            foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.

          <p>
            We can ship to virtually any address in Canada, however there are restrictions on some products, and some
            products cannot be shipped to some destinations. Some products are available for in-store pickup only and are
            not eligible to be shipped. Also, please note that we do not sell or ship internationally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally there are delays outside of our control that prevent our carriers from being able to make their
            scheduled pick-ups. Once your order is picked up by the carrier and leaves our facility, you&apos;ll receive an
            automated email with tracking information. If you didn&apos;t receive this email, please check the spam folder of
            your inbox. If you wish to make a change to your order before it ships, please contact us as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you place an order, shipping costs will be generated for you based on the product weight, product type,
            availability of your items, and the shipping option you choose. Depending on the shipping provider you choose,
            time in transit estimates may appear alongside the shipping quotes. Estimated transit times are provided by
            the shipping provider you choose at checkout, not by CSC.

          <p>
            If you have purchased a firearm that is subject to Chief Firearms Office (CFO) transfer approval, we will ship
            your firearm when we have received notification that the transfer has been approved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please also note that the shipping rates for many items we sell are weight-based. To reflect the policies of
            the shipping companies we use, all weights will be rounded up to the next full pound. Weight-based shipping
            rates are provided by the shipping provider you choose at checkout, not by CSC.

              You may return most new, unopened items within 14 days of the original purchase date for store credit equal
              to the purchase price. We will also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (eg.
              you received an incorrect or defective item). All products returned, not as a result of our error, are
              subject to a 20% restocking fee and associated shipping costs. Any CSC points earned during the purchase

              for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it takes us to process your
              return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund
              request (5 to 10 business days).

            CSC (including CSC’s affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents) does not accept liability beyond
            the remedies set forth herein, including any liability for products not being available for use. CSC will not

            profits, loss of business, or other incidental, indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages, even if
            advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any third party except as expressly provided
            herein. Customer agrees that for any liability related to the purchase of products or services, CSC is not
            liable or responsible for any amount of damages above the aggregate dollar amount paid by customer for the
            purchase of products and/or services under this agreement. The foregoing limitations apply regardless of the
            cause or circumstances giving rise to such loss, damage or liability, even if such loss, damage or liability
            is based on negligence or other torts or breach of contract (including fundamental breach or breach of a
            fundamental term). Neither CSC nor customer may institute any action in any form arising out of this agreement
            more than six (6) months after the cause of action has arisen, or in the case of nonpayment, more than six (6)
            months from the date of last payment. Some provinces do not allow the exclusion of limitation of (I)
            incidental or consequential damages or (ii) implied warranties or conditions, so the above exclusions may not
            apply.

              attempt to resolve any dispute or differences between them by way of good faith negotiation. The good faith
              negotiation shall commence by each party communicating their position regarding the complaint, claim,
              dispute, or controversy to the other party, and how the parties should resolve the dispute. The parties
              shall then make good faith efforts to negotiate a resolution of the claim, dispute, or controversy. Neither
